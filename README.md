PSX Cue Maker
===========

Sometimes when you are looking for PlayStation/PSX roms, you find an archive full of bin files.

Loading the first bin file into an emulator usually allows you to play the game, but with no background music.

This is because the emulator doesn't "see" the other tracks which contain the music. To get the emulator to do that, you must run/mount the game using a cue sheet instead of the bin file itself. A cue sheet works like a track list and allows the emulator to recognise all the tracks in the game and not just the first one.

You can make your own cue sheets with any text editor, but why fiddle with this tedious errorprone processs yourself when it can be automated?

If you have ever wanted an awesome utility to write your PlayStation bin cue sheets automatically, this is it.

Unlike the other tools located on the interwebs, this one supports games comprised of multiple bin track files, with the first file being data and any successive ones being cd audio.

Just pick the folder that contains the bin files and PSX Cue Maker will whip out a cue sheet to let the music play when running your game in epsxe (or another emulator).
